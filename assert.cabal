name:           assert
version:        0.0.1.2
synopsis:       Helpers for Control.Exception.assert
description:
    GHC supports compile-time toggling of run-time assertions via the
    @-fignore-asserts@ flag, which only effects a behavioural change in
    'Control.Exception.assert'. Furthermore the reported location only gives
    the use site of the aforementioned, making it difficult to abstract over
    and hence cumbersome to use.
    .
    This package aims to make assertions more convenient, and also provides
    a rule to rewrite assertions to 'id' when @-fignore-asserts@ is used.
